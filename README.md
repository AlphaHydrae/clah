**Simple JavaScript Inheritance by John Resig**

All credit for the inheritance system goes to John Resig. I adapted it to work both with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) or in a browser, and added a function to generate bound callbacks.

## Installation

With [NPM](https://npmjs.org):

    npm install clah

In a browser:

    <script type='text/javascript' src='/path/to/your/assets/clah.min.js'></script>
